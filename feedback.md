#### Dr. Kuchera's Notes:

**Data exploration:** Did you do any feature selection? Normalization?

**Model choice/exploration** Good model choice. Justification? Why not kNN?

**Code:** Code is well documented except for jupyter file.

**Objective description** Very good.

**Organization** Report is well organized, though analysis description should have been more thorough.


**Analysis** You analysis description could have been more thorough, especially with hyperparameter tuning for each model.


**Results** Great results with appropriate metrics used.


**Writing**  The report is well written.
